# @codeforamerica/blueprint-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a89ec45: **Breaking:** `blueprint-core` now has one entry point instead of seventeen
  subpaths. Import `discover`, `load`, `generate`, `extract`, `resolve`,
  `validate`, `schemasDir` and `baseContractsDir` from the package root;
  `/openapi`, `/rules`, `/validator`, `/overlay`, `/relationships`,
  `/compositions`, `/state-machines`, `/json-schema`, `/registries` and
  `/annotations` no longer resolve. `load` now takes a `DiscoveredFile`, so
  `discover(dir).map(load)` replaces
  `discover(dir).map((f) => load(f.path, f.relativePath))`. `Doc.refs` and
  `Doc.model` are methods rather than fields, because as fields they went stale
  as soon as a resolve pass rewrote `content`. OpenAPI loading and validation
  moved to `blueprint-mock-server`, annotation merging to `blueprint-explorer`,
  and `bundleSpec` to `blueprint-cli`. (#425)
- 15e4b60: **Deprecated:** The `policies-schema.yaml` registry format (`policies:` map) is
  superseded by `registry-schema.yaml` (`type: policies`, `entries:` map). Named
  registry files (`*-registry-{type}.yaml`) are discovered automatically. Both
  formats are supported; the old one will be removed in a future minor version.
- d1a80d3: **Breaking:** JSON schema validation no longer strips `$schema` before
  validating. A schema with `additionalProperties: false` that does not declare
  `$schema` will now fail; add `$schema: { type: string }` to its properties.

  `blueprint-core` also gains rules contract support: a schema for
  `*-rules.yaml`, a compiler producing portable `*-graph.yaml` dependency
  graphs, a validator with cycle and unreachable-node detection and CEL syntax
  checking, and an endpoint overlay generator. (#425)
- 15e4b60: **Breaking:** Annotation files key fields by spec-relative path
  (`application.members[].dateOfBirth`) rather than schema-relative path
  (`member.dateOfBirth`). The first segment is the camelCase schema name,
  followed by the dot-bracket field path. This matches the data dictionary and
  the field inventory, so one path form works across all three.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f440c3: `blueprint-resolve` now exits with a clear error if `blueprint-core`'s base contracts are missing, rather than silently producing broken output. The `base-contracts/` and `assets/` directories are now correctly included in the `blueprint-core` npm package, fixing resolution failures for consumers who installed from npm.
